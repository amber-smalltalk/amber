Amber [![Travis CI Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/NicolasPetton/amber.png)](https://travis-ci.org/#!/NicolasPetton/amber)
=====

By Nicolas Petton <petton.nicolas@gmail.com> and [Amber contributors](https://github.com/NicolasPetton/amber/contributors)

Amber is an implementation of the Smalltalk language that runs on top of the JavaScript runtime. It is designed to make client-side development faster and easier.

Overview
--------

Amber is written in itself, including the parser and compiler. Amber compiles into efficient JavaScript, mapping one-to-one with the equivalent JavaScript. There is no interpretation at runtime.

Some highlights:

-    Amber features an IDE with a Class browser, Workspace, Transcript, a ReferencesBrowser supporting senders/implementors and class references, basic Inspector and even a beginning of a Debugger and a unit TestRunner.
-    [Pharo Smalltalk](http://www.pharo-project.org) is considered as the reference implementation.
-    Amber includes a canvas to generate HTML, like [Seaside](http://www.seaside.st)
-    Amber can use Javascript libraries and the current IDE is built on [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com)
-    You can inline Javascript code and there are many ways to interact between Amber and Javascript
