09th July 2013 - Release 0.11.0
===============================

Three months have passed and we are happy to announce the release
of Amber 0.11.0!

Some numbers about this release:

* 494 commits
* 13 committers
* increasing the number of core committers to 25
* 50 unit tests added to the kernel
* 313 unit tests in total

Since the last release 60 issues were closed, bringing us to 499
issues closed.

This release includes a lot of bug fixes, improvements to the
CLI, as well as a preview of the next IDE, named Helios. Amber
now also uses a CI server [1].

To try the Helios, the new IDE, open the helios.html page, or
evaluate in any other amber page `amber.loadHelios()`.

The compiler also received some improvements, especially
regarding message send optimisations and super sends.

Here's the list of commits and closed issues:

https://github.com/amber-smalltalk/amber/issues?direction=desc&milestone=6&page=1&sort=updated&state=closed

There is a lot more to come with Helios, a stepping debugger
based on the AST is in progress and currently in the 'debugger'
branch on GitHub.

* Installing Amber from NPM

To install amber from NPM, run
    
    npm install amber


* Migration from Amber 0.10.0

Amber compiled code should be compatible with Amber 0.10.0, but
recompiling is needed in order to get contexts working:

    Compiler new recompile: (Package named: 'MyPackage') classes.
    (Package named: 'MyPackage') commit

13th September 2011 - Release 0.9
=================================
Amber has been evolving furiously since the presentation at ESUG 2011 in Edinburgh less than 3 weeks ago.

This is a summary:

Language, compiler and runtime

- New 100x faster parser built using PEGjs instead of the old parser built using PetitParser.
- New much faster ChunkParser implementation in handwritten Amber instead of using PetitParser.
- Improved parsing error report with quoted source code plus marker pinpointing parsing error.
- Removed PetitParser since it is no longer needed by Amber itself.
- Added compiler optimizations in the form of speculative inlining of specific messages and control structures.
- Added support for dynamic Arrays, just like in Squeak/Pharo.
- Added support for similar dynamic Dictionaries, not seen in other Smalltalks.
- Added & and | as allowed binary selectors and implemented them in Boolean.
- Added a Set implementation.
- Added first basic support for real Packages with dependency information.

...and various extensions, enhancements and bug fixes to the library classes.


Development environment

- A working Debugger with integrated inspector, proceed etc.
- A new structure with
- A working amberc command line compiler including a Makefile for recompiling the whole Amber.
- Enabled TestRunner in the IDE for running unit tests based on SUnit.
- Added "File in" button in Workspace to easily paste and filein source code in chunk format in the IDE.


Example code and ports

- Ported ProfStef interactive tutorial, available on Amber homepage but also in examples directory.
- Included the ESUG presentation as an example also in the examples directory.
- Several new examples running on Node.js and webOS included, all with Makefiles.
 
 
Various other things

- Issue tracker on github now used as primary source, closed a bunch of reported issues.
- Wiki pages on github with information on how to port code from other Smalltalks, lists of articles, tutorials, roadmap and more.
