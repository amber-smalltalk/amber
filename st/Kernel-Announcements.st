Object subclass: #Announcer
	instanceVariableNames: 'registry subscriptions'
	package: 'Kernel-Announcements'!
!Announcer commentStamp!
I hold annoncement subscriptions (instances of `AnnouncementSubscription`) in a private registry.
I announce (trigger) announces, which are then dispatched to all subscriptions.

The code is based on the announcements as [described by Vassili Bykov](http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/userblogs/vbykov/blogView?searchCategory=Announcements%20Framework).

## API

Use `#announce:` to trigger an announcement.

Use `#on:do:` or `#on:send:to:` to register subscriptions.

When using `#on:send:to:`, unregistration can be done with `#unregister:`.

## Usage example:

    SystemAnnouncer current
        on: ClassAdded
        do: [ :ann | window alert: ann theClass name, ' added' ].!

		valuable: (MessageSend new
			receiver: anObject;
