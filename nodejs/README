JTalk + Node.js = Awesomeness
=============================
These are some experiments of using JTalk together with Node.js:

jtalkc          - a bash script for compiling JTalk programs.
nodecompile.js  - Node.js javascript code for compiling .st files, used by jtalkc.

hello           - Hello world example with a simple Makefile.
trivialserver   - A slightly larger example.
trivialserver2  - A variation on trivialserver that tries to do more in JTalk.

You will need "node" in your path to try examples.
