JTalk + Node.js = Awesomeness
=============================
These are some experiments of using JTalk together with Node.js:

hello           - Hello world example with a simple Makefile.
benchfib        - Port of tinybenchmarks from Squeak.
trivialserver   - A slightly larger example.

You will need "node" in your path to try all the above.
