JTalk + Node.js = Awesomeness
=============================
These are some experiments of using JTalk together with Node.js:

ntalkc          - a bash script for compiling JTalk programs for Node.js.
nodecompile.js  - trivial Node.js javascript code for compiling .st files, used by ntalkc.

hello           - Hello world example with a simple Makefile
trivialserver   - A slightly larger example.
trivialserver2  - A variation on trivialserver that tries to do more in JTalk.

You will need "node" in your path to try examples.

The "compiler" is simply a bash script that uses Nicolas' Exporter/Importer to compile .st files into .js files. The source code should be easy to follow but basically it does the following:

1. Collect all listed (as arguments) .st and .js files. We also check in the JTalk js and st directories if not found.

2. Create a "compiler" by concatenating these files (this means we always use freshest from git):
        boot.js Kernel.js Parser.js Compiler.js init.js nodejs/nodecompile.js 

3. Run this "compiler" using node and give .st files as command line arguments. This produces corresponding .js files. If not all .js files exist afterwards we abort.

4. Build final program.js by concatenating:

        boot.js
        Kernel.js
        ...all .js libraries collected in step 1.
        ...all .js files produced from the .st files in step 3.
        init.js (either locally or from JTalk js directory)
        main.js (if found locally)

5. Run program.js using node if "-r" was specified.
