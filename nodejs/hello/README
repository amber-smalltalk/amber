Trivial Node.js example in JTalk:

Hello.st - source code.
hello    - trivial bash script to run resulting program.
main.js  - small "doit" to actually run code. Will be added by ntalkc.
Makefile - trivial makefile, read it.

Hello.js - produced when you run make. Contains JTalk + Hello.st + main.js

To play, do this:

make run

...or:

make
./hello
