Trivial Node.js example in JTalk:

TrivialServer.st - source code.
trivial          - trivial bash script to run resulting program.
main.js          - small "doit" to actually run code. Will be added by ntalkc.
Makefile         - trivial makefile, read it.

TrivialServer.js - produced when you run make. Contains JTalk + Hello.st + main.js

To play, do this:

make run

...or:

make
./trivial
