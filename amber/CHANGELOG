13th September 2011 - Release 0.9
=================================
Amber has been evolving furiously since the presentation at ESUG 2011 in Edinburgh less than 3 weeks ago.

This is a summary:

Language, compiler and runtime

- New 100x faster parser built using PEGjs instead of the old parser built using PetitParser.
- New much faster ChunkParser implementation in handwritten Amber instead of using PetitParser.
- Improved parsing error report with quoted source code plus marker pinpointing parsing error.
- Removed PetitParser since it is no longer needed by Amber itself.
- Added compiler optimizations in the form of speculative inlining of specific messages and control structures.
- Added support for dynamic Arrays, just like in Squeak/Pharo.
- Added support for similar dynamic Dictionaries, not seen in other Smalltalks.
- Added & and | as allowed binary selectors and implemented them in Boolean.
- Added a Set implementation.
- Added first basic support for real Packages with dependency information.

...and various extensions, enhancements and bug fixes to the library classes.
