Trivial Node.js example in JTalk that also uses the Google Closure compiler
if ~/compiler.jar is present.

Hello.st - source code.
hello    - trivial bash script to run resulting program.
Makefile - trivial makefile, read it.

Hello.js - produced when you run make. Contains JTalk + Hello.st + a main call

To play, do this:

make
./hello
